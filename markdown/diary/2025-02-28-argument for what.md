we use axioms or deduction rules to give a proof of some conclusions to say it follows the logic or it is logical. we have this criterion of arguments in formal language or natural language.
but what's the purpose of giving a proof or argument? in the most situations, it's not for just saying something but for letting the listeners knowing something, most of which is for pushing the listeners to do something.
Then, something complicated about justifacation of an argument appears.
Maybe some part of the justifacation of an argument is from the outside of the proof system.
example: in a brutal experiment, Tom and Jay is put in a room. people who control all of this will kill Tom except Jay persuade Tom to believe the Earth is flat. and they told Jay how they will act and don't allow Jay to let Tom know about this. now how is Jay's argument about Earth? 
of course we should distinguish between whether an argument is valid and whether he should give the argument.
intuition: we should give valid argument... except ...
yeah it is like the example of WW2 when we talk about Kant's deontology of being honest.
clearly the people who choose to be honest even if in the WW2 situation will choose to unaccept the outside justifacation of an argument.
And the people who choose to lie in the WW2 situation will choose to accept at least some outside justifacation of an argument.
here something "outside" means something unknowable
and more, people who accept it just think there is a chance someone who give the argument possiblly know more than themself and it can't be explained in their (understanding) system.

this is just a little spark of my thinking about those who use language to make a difference but not to say something.
